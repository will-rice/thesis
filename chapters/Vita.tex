After graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies with a focus on Biology and Business from East Tennessee State University, Will Rice decided to change directions and pursue a Masters in Computer Science. In the first year of Masters study, he landed an internship in network administration at Life Care Centers of America. Within the first few months, he discovered a passion for machine learning which lead to an internship in speech and natural language processing at Pylon, ai where he was able to flourish in applications of machine learning and most importantly, generative models. Will assisted in the design and deployment of many deep learning models. The most complex being, a state of the art Text-to-Speech system which is a core component of the app RadioBrain. With a desire to enhance his technical writing, he decided that an important component to his education would be the completion of a thesis that applied generative models to a real world application. This was successfully accomplished with the guidance of Dr. Wu and Dr. Liang in the Networked Intelligence lab in the University of Tennessee at Chattanoogaâ€™s Sim Center. In May 2019, he graduated with an MSc. in Computer Science.
