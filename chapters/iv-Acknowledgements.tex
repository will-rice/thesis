To begin, I would like to acknowledge my wife, Shannon, she was here for all of the ups, downs, and how every new project is "The hardest problem I've ever solved". I could not have made it this far without her by my side. Furthermore, I would like to thank Dr. Wu, Dr. Liang, and everyone in the lab for giving me the opportunity to conduct research in an academic environment and facilitate my growth as a researcher. In addition, I would like to thank Mike Tatum, Brent Spell, Josh Ziegler, and the rest of the team at Pylon ai. From the very beginning they challenged me, which enabled me to grow in the field of machine learning. Without them, I would not have been able to undertake a research project as challenging as this. I also would like to include a special thank you to my thesis committee. The road to defense has been rocky, but we finally made it.
