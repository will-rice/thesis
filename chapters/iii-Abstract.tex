To augment training data for machine learning models in \acrfull{gpr} data classification and identification, this thesis focuses on the generation of realistic \acrshort{gpr} data using Generative Adversarial Networks. An innovative GAN architecture is proposed for generating \acrshort{gpr} B-scans, which is, to the author's knowledge, the first successful application of GAN to \acrshort{gpr} B-scans. As one of the major contributions, a novel loss function is formulated by merging frequency domain with time domain features. To test the efficacy of generated B-scans, a real time object classifier is proposed to measure the performance gain derived from augmented B-Scan images. The numerical experiment illustrated that, based on the augmented training data, the proposed GAN architecture demonstrated a significant increase (from $82\%$ to $98\%$) in the accuracy of the object classifier.
